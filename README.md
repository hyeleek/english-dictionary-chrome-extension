# Chrome Extension English Dictionary
Web Prototype developed with HTML / CSS / JavaScript (React)  
Created by [Hailey Kim](http://hyeleekim.com) as [PUI/SSUI](https://hcii.cmu.edu/courses/programming-usable-interfaces) Fall 2019 assignment at CMU HCII.

### Design Goals
Users will use this extension to search words while reading content on Chrome browser. I imagined the target users to be reading a lot of paper and academic content from website. Usersâ€™ dictionary search history will be automatically saved and user can delete or clear the history as well as revisiting the history.
